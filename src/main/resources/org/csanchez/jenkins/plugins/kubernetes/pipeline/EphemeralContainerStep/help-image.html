<p>
    Docker image reference for the container. The image must have a shell available (i.e. `sh`).
</p>
<p>
    If the image defines an entrypoint it must be able to accept and execute a command and
    arguments. Jenkins must be able to stop the container and to do so it passes a process
    monitor command to know when to exit the container. If the image entrypoint to not
    perform the monitor task the ephemeral container may not work correctly.
