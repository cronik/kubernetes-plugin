        This setting controls if <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/">ephemeral containers</a>
        are allowed to be added to agent Pod using the <code>ephemeralContainer</code> step. Some environments may choose
        to restrict adding containers to an agent Pod during builds for security reasons or limited Pod resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Ephemeral Containers are GA in Kubernetes 1.25+. Prior versions may require a
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/">feature gate</a> to
        enable the feature.
